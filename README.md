## Introduction & Problem

Flappy Bird is a side-scrolling game where the player controls a bird, attempting to navigate through columns of green pipes. The objective is to avoid collisions and score points by successfully navigating through the pipes.

## Technology

The game is implemented using the C# programming language with a focus on Windows Form Application. C# is a programming language developed by Microsoft, and Windows Forms is a graphical user interface API included in Microsoft's .NET Framework.

## Functionalities

The key functionalities of the game include:

- Moving Pipes
- Score Counting
- Objective Selection
- Collision Detection
- Main Menu with Start, Options, Leaderboards, and Quit options
- Sound System with background music, wing sounds, and collision sounds
- Leaderboards displaying the top five scores
- Option to adjust game background music volume
- Quit confirmation with options to exit or return to the main menu
- Levels with increasing pipe speed as the score progresses
- Pause button to pause and resume the game
- Game Over screen with options to retry, return to the main menu, or quit

## Code

The code for the project is organized into multiple forms, each handling specific aspects of the game, such as the logo, main menu, start screen, options, leaderboards, quit confirmation, and game over screen. The code for the game logic, including pipe movement, collision detection, and scoring, is implemented in the `Start_Form`.

## Interfaces

The project includes various forms to create a visually appealing interface for the game. These interfaces include the logo form, main menu form, ready form, start form, option form, leaderboards form, quit form, and game over form.

## Conclusion

The project provided valuable experience in object-oriented programming and graphical user interface design using C# and Windows Forms. It demonstrates the implementation of a classic game and showcases the understanding of game development concepts.
